# caps2ctrl
This application adds a keyboard layout (English, US, qwerty) which changed "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for the physical keyboard.

|#[ESC]-[\`] |#[CapsLock] |#Left Ctrl   |#Menu key   |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| 
|            |   [Ctrl]   |             | [CapsLock] |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   |             | [CapsLock] |
|            |   [Ctrl]   | [Caps Lock] |            |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   | [Caps Lock] |            |

- Instead of the menu key, you can use "[Ctrl] + [ESC]".
- The other keyboard layouts are added as "Japanese (EN)" or "ThumbCtrl (EN)" but these are for Japanese keyboard.

This software uses 'User installable keymap' (Android 4.1 and up).
Therefore, it can not be used on an Android device whose manufacturer disabled "Settings" -> "Languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard" of Android settings.
