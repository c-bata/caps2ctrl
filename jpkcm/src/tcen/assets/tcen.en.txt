# !!! Notice !!!

This software uses 'User installable keymap' (Android 4.1 or higher).
Therefore, it can not be used on an Android device in which "Keyboard layouts" which should be present in Android's "Settings" -> "Languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard" is disabled.

It may not be available on many Asus devices (and several Samsung devices).

# What is this:

This application adds a keyboard layout(English, US, qwerty) which changed "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for the physical keyboard.
Also add a keyboard layout to swap "ESC" and "\`".

English (US), Caps to Ctrl
|#[ESC]-[\`] |#[Caps Lock]|   #Menu key     |
|            |   [Ctrl]   |   [Caps Lock]   |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   |   [Caps Lock]   |

- Instead of the menu key, you can use "[Ctrl] + [ESC]".
- The other 10 keyboard layouts are added as "106/109 English (US)" but this is for Japanese keyboard.

# How to use:

With the physical keyboard connected, change the keyboard layout via Android's "Settings" → "Language & input" → "Physical keyboard".

Depending on the version of Android, the setting location may be different or layout setting may be required for each keyboard application.
