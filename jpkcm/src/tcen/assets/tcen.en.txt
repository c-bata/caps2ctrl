# What is this:
This application adds a keyboard layout (English, US, qwerty) which changed "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for the physical keyboard.
Also add a keyboard layout to swap "ESC" and "\`".

- English (US)
|#[ESC]-[\`] |#[CapsLock] |#Left Ctrl   |#Menu key   |
|            |   [Ctrl]   |             | [CapsLock] |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   |             | [CapsLock] |
|            |   [Ctrl]   | [Caps Lock] |            |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   | [Caps Lock] |            |
- Instead of the menu key, you can use "[Ctrl] + [ESC]".
- The other keyboard layouts are added as "Japanese (EN)" or "ThumbCtrl (EN)" but these are for Japanese keyboard.
