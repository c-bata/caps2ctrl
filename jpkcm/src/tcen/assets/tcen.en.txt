# !!! Notice !!!

This software uses 'User installable keymap' (Android 4.1 and up).
Therefore, it can not be used on an Android device whose manufacturer disabled "Settings" -> "Languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard (Your keyboard device name)" of Android settings.

「&<a href="ACTION_SETTINGS/ACTION_HARD_KEYBOARD_SETTINGS">Settings&</a>」 (Open after connecting a physical keyboard)

For more information, please contact the user support of your Android device.

# What is this:

This application adds a keyboard layout(English, US, qwerty) which changed "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for the physical keyboard.
Also add a keyboard layout to swap "ESC" and "\`".

- English (US)
|#[ESC]-[\`] |#[CapsLock] |#Left Ctrl   |#Menu key   |
|            |   [Ctrl]   |             | [CapsLock] |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   |             | [CapsLock] |
|            |   [Ctrl]   | [Caps Lock] |            |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   | [Caps Lock] |            |

- Instead of the menu key, you can use "[Ctrl] + [ESC]".
- The other keyboard layouts are added as "Japanese (EN)" or "ThumbCtrl (EN)" but these are for Japanese keyboard.


# How to use:

With the physical keyboard connected, change the keyboard layout via Android's "Settings" -> "Languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard (Your keyboard device name)".

Depending on the version of Android, the setting location may be different or layout setting may be required for each keyboard application.
