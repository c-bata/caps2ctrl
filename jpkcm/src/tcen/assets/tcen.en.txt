# !!! Notice !!!

This software uses 'User installable keymap' (Android 4.1 and up).
Therefore, it can not be used on an Android device whose manufacturer disabled "Settings" -> "languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard" of Android settings.
「&<a href="ACTION_SETTINGS.LanguageAndInputSettings">Settings&</a>」

For more information, please contact the user support of your Android device.

# What is this:

This application adds a keyboard layout(English, US, qwerty) which changed "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for the physical keyboard.
Also add a keyboard layout to swap "ESC" and "\`".

English (US), Caps to Ctrl
|#[ESC]-[\`] |#[Caps Lock]|   #Menu key     |
|            |   [Ctrl]   |   [Caps Lock]   |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   |   [Caps Lock]   |

- Instead of the menu key, you can use "[Ctrl] + [ESC]".
- The other 10 keyboard layouts are added as "106/109 English (US)" but These are for Japanese keyboard.

# How to use:

With the physical keyboard connected, change the keyboard layout via Android's "Settings" → "Language & input" → "Physical keyboard".

Depending on the version of Android, the setting location may be different or layout setting may be required for each keyboard application.
