# What is this:

This application adds a keyboard layout(English, US, qwerty) which changed "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for the physical keyboard.
Also add a keyboard layout to swap "ESC" and "\`".

English (US), Caps to Ctrl
|#[ESC]-[\`] |#[Caps Lock]|#Application key |
|            |   [Ctrl]   |   [Caps Lock]   |
|    Swap    |   [Ctrl]   |   [Caps Lock]   |

The other 10 keyboard layouts are added as "106/109 English (US)" but this is for Japanese keyboard.

# How to use:

With the physical keyboard connected, change the keyboard layout via Android's "Settings" → "Language & input" → "Physical keyboard".
./layout_dialog.png

The setting location varies depending on the version of Android.

In Android 7 and later, the layout can be changed for each keyboard application, so please change the layout for the keyboard application to use.

## !!! Notice !!!

This software uses 'User installable keymap' (Android 4.1 or higher).
Therefore, it can not be used on an Android device in which "Keyboard layouts" which should be present in Android's "Settings" -> "Languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard" is disabled.

It may not be available on many Asus devices (and several Samsung devices).
